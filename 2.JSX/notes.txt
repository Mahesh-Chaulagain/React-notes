# JSX:
- stands for Javascript Syntax Extension which lets you use HTML-like syntax in your react components
- every components you see uses JSX
- can easily embed js into JSX
- gives flexibility to build fast UIs
- a function called "React.createElement()" enables us to create JSX elements in react and it accepts threee arguments
    1. the HTML element 
    2. an object containing HTML element's attribute
    3. content of the HTML element
    e.g
        React.createElement(
            'button',
            {
                color: 'white', backgroundColor: 'blue'
            },
            'Click Here'
        )
    [ you don't need to use the 'React.createElement()' function because it creates alot of unnecessary line of codes and will be 
    difficult to create deeply nested JSX elements]

- react provides an easier way of writing JSX elements. They are similar to HTML elements and accept an attribute called 'className'
    that replaces the class attribute in HTML
- two rules concerning the JSX elements
    1. 'class' is a js keyword. therefore use 'className' instead of class when styling your jsx elements
    2. a component can only return one JSX element. but when you need to display more than one jsx element, put them in a single 
        container element

- example that returns a single JSX element
    function Greeting(){
    return (
        <h1 className="heading">Welcome to React</h1>
    )
    }

- example that returns multiple JSX elements
    function Greeting(){
    return (
        <div>
        <h1 className="heading">Welcome to React</h1>
        <p> this is a message from the web</p>
        </div>
    )
    }
