# React:
- js library for building web app user interfaces
- can create a quick and scalable web app by breaking the UI down into smaller components

# Installing with vite:
- npm create vite@latest app_name
- npm install for node modules

# key concepts to understand

1. React components:
- a set of react elements that browser returns which appears on the computer screen
- in react a webpage can be divided into multiple components that make up the entire elements on the screen
- react splits the UI into independent and reusable pieces(components). 
- each component name must start with a capital letter which makes them readable
- have their own styles, APIs, logic and structures
- two types:
    1. class or stateful components:
        - this method of creating react component is considered outdated(not recommended)
        - declared using the js "class" keyword
        - called stateful because the variables within the components are linked to them using the js "this" keyword
        - example:
        import React, { Component } from 'react';

        class HelloWorld extends Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            // Initialize state
            this.state = {
            greeting: 'Hello, World!'
            };
        }

        render() {
            return (
            <div>
                <h1>{this.state.greeting}</h1>
            </div>
            );
        }
        }

    2. Functional Components(Stateless)
    - modern way of writing react
    - follows the js ES6 method of writing functions
    - accepts a single argument known as props(object data), mostly returned with a jsx elements
    - are declared similarly to js functions but difference is that components accepts props and render jsx elements
