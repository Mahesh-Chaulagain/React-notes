# State:
-> a collection of information or objects that tell you where you can access and store your data
-> anything outside of a component, for example can't access its data. it's private and controlled by the component
-> every react component has its own state
    - whenever a state changes, the component get re-rendered
    - this happens when a user clicks a button, responds or interact with something on the page
-> the children components can access these states via props passed by the parent's component
-> example  
    const[name, setName] = useState("")
    const[age, setAge] = useState(0)
    const[products, setProducts] = useState(["rice","beans"])

-> a state can be an array, string, object or number
-> the useState hook accepts the initial value of the state as a parameter, and the state name and state function( for modifying its value)
    are destructed from the useState hook
    syntax:
        const[stateName, stateFunction] = useState(<initial_value>)
